# project_ideas
## Purpose
This repo contains a single markdown file of ideas for open source software
## Ideas
- Aspen plus/HYSYS output to pyomo model for heat exchanger network flexibility analysis
  - A simple proof of concept would be to just have a single HX flexibility analysis straight from Aspen
  - This would require some way to trace the relevant streams though the flowsheet to find the streams which relate to the HX network and ones that don't
